This project aims to **predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** and **assess dialysis needs** using clinical and biochemical indicators. It features:

- A complete ML pipeline (EDA â†’ preprocessing â†’ modeling â†’ evaluation)
- A **Streamlit app** for interactive risk prediction
- A clean, interpretable codebase and notebook

## How to Run the Project Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nasser-chaouchi/ckd_dialysis_prediction.git
cd ckd-dialysis-prediction
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Launch the Streamlit app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```


## ML Models Used

Two binary classification tasks were addressed:

1. **CKD Detection** â€“ Whether a patient has Chronic Kidney Disease  
2. **Dialysis Need Prediction** â€“ Whether a CKD patient needs dialysis

We evaluated the following models:

- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest 
- Gradient Boosting  
- K-Nearest Neighbors  
- XGBoost  

After evaluation, **Random Forest** was selected for both tasks due to:

- High F1-macro scores  
- Balanced performance across classes  
- Robustness to outliers and feature scaling  
- Interpretability through feature importance

## Business Impact

Chronic Kidney Disease is a major global health challenge, with millions of patients requiring costly long-term care.  
This project demonstrates how machine learning models can support:

- **Early detection** of CKD for timely intervention  
- **Prediction of dialysis needs** to anticipate hospital resources  
- **Decision support** for healthcare professionals  

Such predictive models highlight the potential of **AI-assisted healthcare**, reducing risks and optimizing treatment strategies.
